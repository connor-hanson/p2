Contributions:
  Connor - queue setup, enqueue/dequeue
  Tiger - sychronization and thread setup

Notes:
  Ctrl+d (EOF) terminates the program in a graceful manner, printing out the desired queue statistics. 
  At EOF, NULL is passed through the queue. We're including this in the enqueue and dequeue count in stats
